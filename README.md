## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a lot about DOM manipulation, events, and color changes

### Continued development

I definitely need more practice with DOM manipulations as this took me several hours over a few days to complete.
